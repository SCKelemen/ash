# ash
friendly assembly

## abstract

Ash is a higher-level abstraction over machine code similar to Assembly. The Goal of Ash is to offer developers high-level programming constructs and greater code familiarity than traditional assembly, while maintaining the low-level and direct control that assembly offers.

## motivation

Developers should feel familiar with the language and code from baremetal to cloud.

## Syntax

Ash is part of a complete language systems that also include [Ember](https://github.com/sckelemen/ember) and [Blaze](https://github.com/sckelemen/blaze). These three language share the same core syntax, but each are extended to support their target niche.
